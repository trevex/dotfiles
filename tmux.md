Some random notes regarding tmux as I might want to integrate it into my workflow:

## Single way to navigate

tmux+yabai
https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd/issues/116
conditional mapping in vim
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42024181/how-to-write-a-conditional-mapping-in-vim
vim-tmux-navigator
https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator

Putting this together unified navigation could look as follows:
1. use vim-tmux-navigator => vim+tmux basically set
2. add tmux+yabai workaround
3. add conditional vim mapping to do yabai navigation if there is no split
