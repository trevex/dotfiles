# My `dotfiles`

This repository contains all my dotfiles.

Initially I started of with a structure similar to [balsoft](https://github.com/balsoft/nixos-config) but later included elements from [hlissner](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles). While putting them together I was also looking at code from [misterio](https://git.sr.ht/~misterio/nix-config) and [imMaturana](https://codeberg.org/imMaturana/nixos-config). Therefore my dotfiles are somewhat of a Frankenstein, but I wanted to give credit where credit is due, so all their licenses are included in the LICENSE file.
