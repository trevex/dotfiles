# My `dotfiles`

This repository contains all my dotfiles.

Initially I started of with a structure similar to [balsoft](https://github.com/balsoft/nixos-config) but later included elements from [hlissner](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles). While putting them together I was also looking at code from [misterio](https://git.sr.ht/~misterio/nix-config), [imMaturana](https://codeberg.org/imMaturana/nixos-config) and [pinpox](https://github.com/pinpox/nixos). All licenses are included in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE)-file.
